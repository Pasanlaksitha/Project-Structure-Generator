# Directory Tree Generator

This Python script generates a visual representation of a directory tree, either printing it to the console or saving it to a file. It can be useful for documenting the structure of a project, particularly when you want to include the directory layout in documentation or README files.

## Features

- Recursively prints the directory tree starting from a specified root directory.
- Saves the directory tree structure to a specified text file with UTF-8 encoding.

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   You can run the script directly by executing it with Python:

   ```bash
   python genrator.py <directory> <output_file>


Replace genrator.py with the actual name of your Python file.

- <directory>: The root directory from which to start the tree.
- <output_file>: The name of the output file where the directory structure will be saved.


```bash
python genrator.py C:\Projects\Python\ project_structure.txt
